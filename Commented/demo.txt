1) Code commented 

2) Understanding of LM35 ADC conversion and scaling
- 10mV per C
- To read this voltage, it uses 10bit ADC to convert alalogue voltage into a digital number
- Main is always reading current temp and updating sevenseg



3) Understanding of LCD + Update logic
- LCD runs in 4bit mode, each char is sent in 2 nibbles
- Each nibble placed on D4-D7
-

4) Understanding of SevenSeg multiplexing and update logic
- Uses segment lines PORTD
- Individual digits are selected by RA0-RA3
- Only one digit can be lit at a time, so we use multiplexing:
	-Timer0 refreshes display every 2ms
